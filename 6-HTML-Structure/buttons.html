<!-- Learning how to use CSS creating some good style buttons:
- The CSS has a selector that is the object we are working in (button) 
- The left word is the CSS property that is what are we changing 
- The right word is the CSS value that is what are we changing the property to -->

<!-- In the color properties we are using RGB (Red-Green-Blue) -->
<!-- In the size properties we are using pixels that is a common unit in CSS -->

<!-- If we start the selector with . then we are referring to a class -->

<!-- We used Chrome DevTools to get the exact colors and size-->

<!-- We are going to replace height and width for padding-->
